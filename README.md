# Solutions-affecting-RFID-Antenna-Gain
This was the final project for Professor Omid Abari's CS219 Advanced IoT &amp; Connectivity course taken in Spring 2023. I started this project in Professor Abari's IoT and Connectivity course in Winter 2022.

I started this project with Rathin Singha (Github: rsingha108) in Winter 22 and continued it with Sirapop "Mark" Theeranantachai (Github: markverick) in Spring 23.

This repo contains the following:
1. NFC-RFIDAntn_gain.ino - Our code to measure Antenna Gain
2. Reports Folder - Folder containing Winter 22 and Spring 23 reports for these projects.
3. Results Folder - Folder containing PNGs of the results we obtained in Spring 2023
4. SetupDiagrams - Experiment Setup Illustrations and Images
5. NextSteps - Image of STL and STL file we recommend people use to continue this experiment.
